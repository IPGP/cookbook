## 1. Ingredients

2 glasses of flour 

2 glasses of boiled water

1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 litre Extra Virgin Olive Oil

sugar to sprinkle on the top of churros


## 2. Preparation

1. To start, a few recommendations from us:
2. You should make churros using an original "churrera". You can use a pastry bag but the churros need to be rigged, to avoid them to explode or overcookwhen fried.
3. To make a proper dough use BOILING water: hot water won’t mix properly with flour.
4. Always be careful! We use extremely hot water and oil, so take all possible precautions to avoid burns.

## 3. Method
1. Add flour, bicarbonate and salt to a bowl
2. Add the boiling water all at once and mix with a wooden spoon until you get an even textured and thick dough
3. If you are using it, put the dough in the churrera, make the churros and place on the table. If you don’t have one, feel free to use a pastry bag with 1m wilton tip.
4. Fry the churros in very hot Extra Virgin Olive Oil
5. Remove the churros and place them on kitchen paper to remove residual oil.
6. Serve with sprinkled sugar and a cup of hot chocolate!
