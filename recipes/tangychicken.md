> "Chicken is a lean “flavor canvas” that cries out for the sweet hot flavor of peppadew chiles, a pickled pepper from South Africa. Once you pick a jar of peppadews from your local pickle aisle, you’ll see what you’ve been missing. Just wrap this delicious chicken mixture in kale and crunch away. Compounds in peppadews, and all spicy chiles, are not only great for your skin but also heart healthy, since they can help to lower blood pressure." - The Beauty Chef

##Ingredients for a wonderful family (4 members)

- 1 lb [455 g] boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-in [2.5-cm] pieces
- 1 cup [160 g] pitted black olives, chopped
- 1 cup [160 g] jarred peppadew chiles or 1 cup [136 g] pickled jalapeño chiles
- 2 Tbsp grass-fed butter or coconut oil
- 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar or balsamic vinegar
- 1 Tbsp herbes de Provence or Italian seasoning
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 8 oz [230 g] crumbled feta
- 1 bunch kale, stemmed
- 6 scallions, thinly sliced, green and white parts

Put the chicken, olives, peppadews, butter, vinegar, herbes de Provence, paprika, and pepper in the slow cooker and toss well. Cover the slow cooker and cook on the low setting for 1½ to 2 hours, until the chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle with the feta, cover the slow cooker, and let rest for 5 minutes, until the cheese melts.

Arrange the kale leaves on a large platter and divide the chicken mixture between the leaves. Garnish with the scallions and serve immediately.

Enjoy!
